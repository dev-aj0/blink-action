## Have an EEG headset (I used the Muse 2 Headband) 🧠

### Software Needed:

- Python (I used version 3.11.0, I’d recommend this too)
- PyLSL
- MuseLSL
- BlueMuse
- VsCode (You could technically use the python IDLE, but this is just much easier. Highly recommend this or any other established IDE you prefer.)
